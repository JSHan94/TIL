## Distribution of Public keys
 
 
### Public Announcement

RSA와 같은 public key 암호방식에서, 사용자들은 자신의 공개 키를 다른 사용자나 그룹에게 전파하는 것이 가능하다

하지만 이와 같은 방식은 악의적인 유저(M)가, 다른 사람(A)인 척하며 공개키(PK_A)를 전파하는 것이 가능한 문제가 있다

A 유저가 다른 유저들에게 Alert하기 전에, M은 A의 암호 메세지들을 계속 보는 것이 가능함

### Publicly Available Directory

신뢰할수있는 엔터티에 의해 public directory가 관리됨

과정은 다음과 같다

- TTE(Trusted Entity)가 각 유저의 <name, public key> 디렉토리를 관리함
- 각 유저들은 디렉토리에 public key를 register함
- 유저는 기존의 키를 어떠한 이유던지, 언제든 새로운 키로 바꿀 수 있음

이는 Public announcement보다 안전하기는 하지만 여전히 취약점이 존재함. A hacker can obtain the private key of directory or temper with the information kept by directory.

### Public Key Authority

It gives stronger security. A central authority keeps a dynamic directory of public keys of all users. Each user knows the public key of authority

- User A sends a time stamped message to public-key authority containig a request for the current public key of user B.
- The authority responds with a message that is encrypted using the authority's private key, PR_auth. Thus, A is able to decrypt the message using the authority's pbulic key. Therefore, A is assured that the message originated with the authority.
- The message includes : 
  - B's public key, PU_b, which A can use to encrypt messages destined for B
  - The original request used to enable A to match this reponse with the corresponding earlier request and to verify that the original request was not altered before reception by the authority
  - The original timestamp given so A can determine that this is not an old message from the authority containing a key other than B's current public key 
- A stores B's public key and also uses it to encrypt a message to B containing an identifier of A (ID_A) and a nonce (N_1), which is used **to identify this transaction uniquely**.
- B retreives A's public key from the authority in the same manne as A retrieved B's public key
- B sends a message to A encrypted with PU_a and containing A's nonce (N1) as well as a new nonce generated by B (N2). Becuase only B could have decrypted message, the presence of in message assure A that the correspondent is B
- A returns N_2, which is encrypted using B's public key, to assure B that its correspondent is A

### Public Key Certificates

The directoy of names and public keys maintained by the authority is vulnerable to tampering.

An alternative approach is to use certificates.

In essence, a certificate consists of **a public key, an identifier of the key owner, and the whole block signed by a trusted third party**

Typically, the third party is a certificate authority, such as a government agency or financial institution that is trusted by the user community

A user can present public key to the authority in a secure manner and obtain a certificate.

The user can then publish the certificate. Anyone needing this user's public key can obtain the certificate and verify that it is valid by way of the attached trusted signature

Other participants can verify that the certificate was created by the authority

We can place the following requirements on this scheme:

- Any participant can read a certificate to determine the name and public key of the certificate's owner.
- Any participant can verify that the certificate originated from the certificate authority and is not counterfeit.
- Only the certificate authority can create and update certificates
- Any participant can verify the certificate
